Sidewalk of Theseus

How many spots of gum should there be?
What are the chances of ice cream spilling here?
Should a mailbox be tagged at least three times or four?
The cement should be cracked and a little buckled.

Should the grass be a little brown?
Should the leaves be a bit bitten?
Should the trunk be stained with dog pee?
How many rusted staples should their be in that pole?

There are granite curbs, it must be New England.
In Baltimore there would be chicken bones everywhere.
Those weeds look tropical it must be San Paulo.
How wet can Los Angeles be?

Does a sign in French make it Paris or just Canada?
Does a sign in Chinese make it Hong Kong or New York?

I think I saw this lamppost in Kuala Lampur or was it Minneapolis?

Someone left a shiny new bolt on that ledge.
Someone has splattered paint in this crosswalk almost like a Polluck.
There is a large pile of gliter near this storefront.
