# One hundred sketches

This repo contains the sketches from my One hundred sketches project. Many of the sketches are code based but the project isn't exclusively about programming. Included here are most of my source files for the sketches. I included a thumbnails as well as a description of how I made the sketches where applicable.

You can see the project page at: [http://kellyegan.net/2016/07/onehundred.html]
